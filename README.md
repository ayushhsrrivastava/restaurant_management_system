A modern, full-stack **Restaurant Management Solution** designed to bridge the gap between customer convenience and administrative control. This app features a digital QR-menu for customers and a high-performance dashboard for admins.



## 🌟 Key Features

### 👨‍💼 Admin Features (The Command Center)
- **Live Order Stream:** Individual order tracking with real-time status updates.
- **Persistent Analytics:** Daily revenue and profit tracking that survives page reloads.
- **Smart Completion Logic:** When an order is marked as "Completed", it automatically updates the table status and archives the revenue.
- **Table Management:** Visual indicators for "Available" vs "Occupied" tables.

### 📱 Customer Features (Digital Menu)
- **QR-Code Access:** Zero-install menu access via browser.
- **Live Cart:** Add items, view total, and place orders directly to the kitchen.
- **Order Tracking:** Customers can view the progress of their food without calling a waiter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** `Flask` (Python)
- **Database:** `SQLAlchemy` (SQLite)
- **Frontend:** `Bootstrap 5`, `JavaScript` (ES6+), `HTML5`, `CSS3`
- **Architecture:** RESTful API with JSON communication

## 📊 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/orders/live` | Fetches all non-completed orders |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/orders/update/<id>` | Marks an order as Completed/Kitchen |
| `GET` | `/api/analytics` | Returns daily revenue/profit totals |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/tables/clear/<id>` | Manually resets a table session |

## 🛡️ Key Logic: Data Persistence

Unlike basic apps that lose data on refresh, this system calculates analytics based on hard-saved database statuses:

* **Completed Orders** are filtered by a `UTC midnight cutoff` to ensure the dashboard shows today's earnings accurately.
* **Naive Timestamps** are used to ensure cross-platform timezone compatibility between the server and the browser.
